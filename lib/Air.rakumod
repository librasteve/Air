=head1 Air

This raku module provides the glue for the B<HARC stack> (HTMX, Air, Raku|Red, Cro).

B<HARC> websites are written in functional code. This puts the emphasis firmly onto the content and layout of the site, rather than boilerplate markup that can often obscure the intention.

The result is a compact, legible and easy-to-maintain website codebase.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
#!/usr/bin/env raku

use Air::Functional :BASE;
use Air::Base;

my &index = &page.assuming( #:REFRESH(1),
    title       => 'hÃ…rc',
    description => 'HTMX, Air, Raku, Cro',
    footer      => footer p ['Aloft on ', b safe '&Aring;ir'],
    );


my &planets = &table.assuming(
    :thead[["Planet", "Diameter (km)",
            "Distance to Sun (AU)", "Orbit (days)"],],
    :tbody[["Mercury",  "4,880", "0.39",  "88"],
           ["Venus"  , "12,104", "0.72", "225"],
           ["Earth"  , "12,742", "1.00", "365"],
           ["Mars"   ,  "6,779", "1.52", "687"],],
    :tfoot[["Average",  "9,126", "0.91", "341"],],
    );


sub SITE is export {
    site #:bold-color<blue>,
        index
            main
                div [
                    h3 'Planetary Table';
                    planets;
                ]
}
=end code


=head1 GETTING STARTED

Install raku - eg. from L<rakubrew|https://rakubrew.org>, then:

=begin code :lang<bash>
### Install Air, Cro & Red
- zef install --/test cro
- zef install Red --exclude="pq:ver<5>"
- zef install Air, Air::Play

### Run and view it
- export WEBSITE_HOST="0.0.0.0" && export WEBSITE_PORT="3000"
- raku -Ilib service.raku
- Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000
=end code

Cro has many other options as documented at L<Cro|https://cro.raku.org> for deployment to a production server.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Air is not a framework, but a set of libraries. Full control over the application loop is retained by the coder.

Air does not provide an HTML templating language, instead each HTML tag is written as a subroutine call where the argument is a list of C<@inners> and attributes are passed via the raku Pair syntax C<:name<value>>. L<Cro templates|https://cro.raku.org/docs/reference/cro-webapp-template-syntax> are great if you prefer that approach.

Reusability is promoted by the structure of the libraries - individuals and teams can create and install your own libraries to encapsulate design themes, re-usable web components and best practice.

Air is comprised of three core libraries:

=item Air::Functional - wraps HTML tags as functions
=item Air::Base - a set of handy prebuilt components
=item Air::Component - make your own components

The Air documentation is at L<https://librasteve.github.io/Air>
